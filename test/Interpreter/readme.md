1. `simple.java`: no method invocation required. Prints string literals and integer expressions.
2. `loop.java`: asks for an implementation of method invocation: no parameters, belongs to a class with no instance variables. Computes factorial and prints the result.
3. `array.java`: Tests array access and do bubble sorting. If interpreted correctly, the sorting should be successful.
4. `array_print.java`: Tests while loop with the array, array access, bubble sorting, array length, and passing an arrray as an arg. 
5. `basicIf.java`: Tests multiple if statements within main without a method call.
6. `number.java`: Tests complicated computation (n choose k, greatest common divisor). It requires method invocation with arguments to be implemented.
7. `HanoiDemo.java`: Tests recursive method call. Requires implementation of `this`.
8-10. `multiplePrint*`: Tests printing and expresion functionality within main().
